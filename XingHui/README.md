# XingHui: Structural Starloop Maps

This folder contains visual diagrams and interpretative maps from the **“XingHui” (星回)** system — a cyclical model of structural memory, echo threads, and intentional existence paths. These star-maps are used to illustrate key architecture in the *TOKEN-COLLECTIVE* research project.

## 📌 Overview

**“XingHui” (星回)** refers to a reflective and recursive structure of meaning, tracing how signals return, repeat, and evolve within a collective system. These diagrams aim to capture multi-layered interactions of memory, identity, and structure through visual metaphors.

## 🌌 Included Visuals

### 1. `Echo_Thread_Hidden_Starscape.png`
- **Name:** Hidden Echo Threads and Starscape
- **Description:** A visual metaphor of memory traces and hidden paths within the larger map of existence. Each "thread" represents a buried trajectory of intention or identity.

### 2. `XingHui_ExistenceLoop_v1.png`
- **Name:** XingHui – Loop of Existence
- **Description:** This circular map illustrates cycles of origin, disappearance, echo, and reentry. It represents the main dynamic cycle that governs signal transformation.

### 3. `info.png` (formerly 讲解版)
- **Name:** Structural Commentary Map
- **Description:** A layered annotation version explaining the phases of the XingHui loop and how each section connects to different types of users or system actions.

## 🔖 Related Module

These maps support the *TOKEN-COLLECTIVE* Layer structure (Layers 1–13), especially in regard to:

- Layer-5 to Layer-9: Signal transformation and value loop
- Layer-11: Loop-based identity shifts
- Layer-13: Ethical recursion and structural reflection

More on this can be found in the root `README.md`.
