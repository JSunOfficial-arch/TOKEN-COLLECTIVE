# TOKEN-COLLECTIVE  
*From Individual Synchrony to Structural Consensus*

## 📘 Project Overview

TOKEN-COLLECTIVE is a research and prototyping initiative that explores how token structures — as cognitive triggers — can generate high-precision synchrony between individuals, and scale up to structural consensus across collectives. This project bridges AI interpretability, human behavioral patterns, and distributed language coordination.

We approach token not only as linguistic units, but as **activation nodes** for emotional resonance, experiential memory, and structural behavior. The project includes simulations, case studies, and proposed methodologies for building token-based interaction systems.

## 🧠 Core Hypotheses

1. **Token Resonance**: Certain tokens consistently trigger synchronized reactions across users due to shared cognitive scaffolding.
2. **Implicit Contract Encoding**: Structural behaviors — such as silence, order, or timing — function as pre-linguistic contractual signals.
3. **Intent Trajectory Mapping**: Predicting user intent is not about language prediction alone, but about aligning to goal structures and behavioral compression.

## 🌀 Layer Structure

This repository maps the theoretical and practical structure into modular “Layers,” including:

- `Layer-0`: Subcognitive root principles  
- `Layer-1–3`: Token activation, emotion, and structure patterning  
- `Layer-4–9`: Group contract modeling, mismatch handling, and resilience  
- `Layer-10–13`: Human-AI ethical interface, de-domestication logic  
- `Layer-14`: Real-world application & capital integration (📌 NEW — see `layer14.md`)

Each Layer is designed to operate independently while feeding into a larger cross-layer model.
